Learning Git is... no small task.
But I am here to help.
First things first...

Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

Then, install WebStorm from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/

Assuming you have a Github account,
Open Webstorm and Ctrl+Alt+S

System Preferences should pop up,
select "Version Control" then "Git"

Enter the path, or location of the git.exe file,
in the "Path to Git executable" box

Now go to the "Appearance & Behavior" tab,
select "System Settings" then "Passwords"
and follow the steps

On Github there should be a button that says
"Create New Repository"

Make sure it's public and includes a readme file

Re-open WebStorm and press "Get from VCS"
(To import your repository from Git)

Type the URL of the repository you made in Git

You should have access to the repository locally

Create 2 files,
press | File > New | in the top left corner of your screen

Create and HTML file for HTML
follow the instruction for it to add to Git

And a Stylesheet file for CSS
follow the instruction for it to add to Git

Select | Git > Commit | at the top of your screen

Add an appropriate message and click "Commit"

Select | Git > Push | at the top of your screen

Click to the right of the arrow from "master"

Enter the path for the master branch

Check to see if created files are included in the push

Click "Push"

Your file should now be on Github

If not, something(s) went wrong

However, don't be afraid to restart the process,
tinker, and keep trying until it works.

When you become familiar with this process
you should set up Github Pages

Go to settings in your repository
and check the repository name

Now on Github Pages select your master branch
and check the generated URL

Copy and paste it into a browser

You should be able to see your first repository!

# Glossary
**Branch** - Branches separate work in repositories.
Whether for testing, organization, etc.

**Clone** - Making an exact copy of a repository or branch.

**Commit** - It's changing an individual file.

**Fetch** - Pulls in all commits from the cloud
but doesn't change your local files.

**GIT** - Version control system that allows you to
track changes in your files.

**Github** - Cloud-based hosting service where you can
manage Git repositories.

**Merge** - Syncs remote content references and heads
into a new local merge commit.

**Merge Conflict** - Happens when Git can't resolve
differences in code between two commits.

**Push** - Upload local repositories to a remote repository.

**Pull** - A fetch, followed by a merge.
Less safe, so use wisely, but more efficient.
